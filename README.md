#### About me

I'm an ML engineer, working on cool projects at the intersection of NLP and CV. I finished my PhD in 2011, worked at the Research Institute for AI (Romanian Academy) for a few years, back when phrased-based statistical machine translation was king, then as a ML engineer at Sustainalytics, and from 2020 at Adobe. 

I'm active in open source, especially on Romanian NLP. Throughout the years I've published, teached and coded, all while having fun. I like to build stuff.

Showcase on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/dumitrescustefan):

* [Named Entity Recognition playground](https://huggingface.co/spaces/dumitrescustefan/NamedEntityRecognition-Romanian)  
* [Write with transformers](https://huggingface.co/spaces/dumitrescustefan/romanian-text-generation), but for Romanian :) 

### Working on

#### Under development:

* Word Sense Disambiguation da
* NLI
* Sentence segmentation

#### 2022

* ``Nov`` Released the **first T5-base and large pretrained checkpoints on Romanian**, trained on TPUv4s from TRC. Invaluable help from @mihai and @peregil.
* ``Nov`` Organized the first edition of the LiRo NLP Hackathon in Politehnica University of Bucharest, with over 80 participants. Thanks to @viorica and @petru and all the wonderful volunteers. 
     
* ``roner`` Released [roner](), a pip-installable custom NER based on RONECv2, providing SOTA results on Romanian.  
#### 2021

* ``asd`` Trained and released a [monolingual GPT-Neo 678M]() model, trained on a TPUv3-32 with the help of 
* I lead the development of the first ML leaderboard named LiRo Benchmark, together with @viorica and other nice RomaniaAI volunteers 
* ``ad`` Lead the development of the first Named Entity Recognition dataset for Romanian. 15 classes, xx entities in xx tokens.
* ``asd`` Proposed and lead the development of the Romanian Semantic Textual Similarity dataset. It's a 1:1 high-quality human translation of the English STS dataset. * 

#### 2020

* April: Trained an released the *first monolingual Romanian BERT model* with @ and @ .  

#### 2019 and before

* [RoWordNet](https://github.com/dumitrescustefan/RoWordNet) [pip package](https://pypi.org/project/rowordnet/) providing quick access to the Romanian WordNet. After all these years it's still the only python plug-and-play package for Romanian - seems to be working well :)
* Developed [NLP-Cube](https://github.com/adobe/NLP-Cube) with @tiberiu (lead). Started as an entry in the 2018 Conll competition and evolved into a multilingual toolkit providing Tokenization, Sentence Segmentation, Lemmatization, POS and DEP parsing, trained on the Universal Dependencies dataset. Unfortunately, it's not longer actively maintained.
