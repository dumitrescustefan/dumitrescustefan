### About me

I'm an ML engineer, working on cool projects at the intersection of NLP and CV. I finished my PhD in 2011, worked as a researcher at the Research Institute for AI (Romanian Academy) for a few years, then switched to more applied ML as an ML engineer at Sustainalytics (2017-2019) and now at Adobe.

I'm active in open source, especially on Romanian NLP. Throughout the years I've published, teached and coded, all while having fun. I like to build stuff.

Showcase on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/dumitrescustefan):

* [Named Entity Recognition playground](https://huggingface.co/spaces/dumitrescustefan/NamedEntityRecognition-Romanian)  
* [Write with transformers](https://huggingface.co/spaces/dumitrescustefan/romanian-text-generation), but for Romanian :) 

### Project I'm proud of, throughout the years

#### Under development:

* Word Sense Disambiguation da
* NLI
* Sentence segmentation

#### 2022

* ``Nov`` Released the **first T5-base and large pretrained checkpoints on Romanian**, trained on TPUv4s from TRC. Invaluable help from [Mihai Ilie](https://github.com/iliemihai) and [Per Egil](https://huggingface.co/north).
* ``Nov`` Organized the first edition of the [LiRo NLP Hackathon](https://sites.google.com/view/liro-hackathon/liro-nlp-hackathon) in Politehnica University of Bucharest, with over 80 participants. Thanks to [Viorica Patraucean](https://www.linkedin.com/in/viorica-patraucean-581a7131/), [Traian Rebedea](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trebedea/) and all the wonderful volunteers. 
* ``Jan`` Released [roner](https://huggingface.co/spaces/dumitrescustefan/romanian-text-generation), a [pip-installable](https://pypi.org/project/roner/) custom NER based on [RONECv2](https://github.com/dumitrescustefan/ronec), providing SOTA results on Romanian.  

#### 2021

* ``Aug`` Trained and released a [monolingual GPT-Neo 780M](https://huggingface.co/dumitrescustefan/gpt-neo-romanian-780m) model, trained on a TPUv3-32 with the help of [Mihai Ilie](https://github.com/iliemihai)
* ``ad`` Lead the development of the first Named Entity Recognition dataset for Romanian. 15 classes, xx entities in xx tokens.
* ``asd`` Proposed and lead the development of the Romanian Semantic Textual Similarity dataset. It's a 1:1 high-quality human translation of the English STS dataset. * 

#### 2020

* ``Aug`` I lead the development of the first ML leaderboard named [LiRo Benchmark](https://lirobenchmark.github.io/), together with [Viorica Patraucean](https://www.linkedin.com/in/viorica-patraucean-581a7131/) and other nice RomaniaAI volunteers 

* April: Trained an released the *first monolingual Romanian BERT model* with @ and @ .  

#### 2019 and before

* [RoWordNet](https://github.com/dumitrescustefan/RoWordNet) [pip package](https://pypi.org/project/rowordnet/) providing quick access to the Romanian WordNet. After all these years it's still the only python plug-and-play package for Romanian - seems to be working well :)
* Developed [NLP-Cube](https://github.com/adobe/NLP-Cube) with @tiberiu (lead). Started as an entry in the 2018 Conll competition and evolved into a multilingual toolkit providing Tokenization, Sentence Segmentation, Lemmatization, POS and DEP parsing, trained on the Universal Dependencies dataset. Unfortunately, it's not longer actively maintained.
