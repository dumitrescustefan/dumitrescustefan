### About me

<img align="right" width="230" height="230" src="stefan_dumitrescu.png">

I'm an Machine Learning Engineer, working on cool projects at the intersection of NLP and CV. I finished my PhD in 2011, worked as a Research Scientist at the Research Institute for AI (Romanian Academy) for 7 years, then switched applied ML as an ML engineer at Sustainalytics (2017-2019) and now at Adobe. 


I'm active in open source, especially on Romanian NLP. Throughout the years I've published, teached and coded, all while having fun. I like to build stuff.

Showcase on [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/dumitrescustefan):

* [Named Entity Recognition playground](https://huggingface.co/spaces/dumitrescustefan/NamedEntityRecognition-Romanian)  
* [Write with transformers](https://huggingface.co/spaces/dumitrescustefan/romanian-text-generation), but for Romanian :)

### Projects I'm proud of

#### Under development:

* Romanian Text Corpus (joint project with [Mihai Ilie](https://github.com/iliemihai))
* Word Sense Disambiguation Corpus & Models for Romanian (large scale, long running project)
* NLI Corpus for Romanian
* Sentence segmentation for Romanian (because current Romanian tools fail miserably for anything but clean text)

#### 2023

* ``May`` Appeared on live TV discussing AI ([#1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DrtCxIdqsNg&ab_channel=Canal33), [#2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjmlOGm4_tY&ab_channel=Canal33))
* ``Apr`` Participated in [WE Smart Diaspora](https://eunivercitiesnetwork.com/west-university-of-timisoara-hosts-smart-diaspora-2023/) conference in Timisoara, Romania, presenting "The Impact of Large Language Models"

#### 2022

* ``Nov`` Released the **first T5-base and large pretrained checkpoints on Romanian**, trained on TPUv4s from TRC. Invaluable help from [Mihai Ilie](https://github.com/iliemihai) and [Per Egil](https://huggingface.co/north).
* ``Nov`` Organized the first edition of the [LiRo NLP Hackathon](https://sites.google.com/view/liro-hackathon/liro-nlp-hackathon) in Politehnica University of Bucharest, with over 80 participants. Thanks to [Viorica Patraucean](https://www.linkedin.com/in/viorica-patraucean-581a7131/), [Traian Rebedea](https://www.linkedin.com/in/trebedea/) and all the wonderful volunteers. 
* ``Jan`` Released [roner](https://huggingface.co/spaces/dumitrescustefan/romanian-text-generation), a [pip-installable](https://pypi.org/project/roner/) custom NER based on [RONECv2](https://github.com/dumitrescustefan/ronec), providing SOTA results on Romanian.  

#### 2021

* ``Aug`` Trained and released a [monolingual GPT-Neo 780M](https://huggingface.co/dumitrescustefan/gpt-neo-romanian-780m) model, trained on a TPUv3-32 with the help of [Mihai Ilie](https://github.com/iliemihai)
* ``Nov`` Lead the development of the first [Named Entity Recognition dataset](https://github.com/dumitrescustefan/ronec) for Romanian. Currently, at version 2.0, holds 12330 sentences with over 0.5M tokens, annotated with 15 classes, to a total of 80.283 distinctly annotated entities. Invaluable help from [termene.ro](https://termene.ro/).

#### 2020

* ``Aug`` I lead the development of the first ML leaderboard named [LiRo Benchmark](https://lirobenchmark.github.io/), together with [Viorica Patraucean](https://www.linkedin.com/in/viorica-patraucean-581a7131/) and other amazing RomaniaAI volunteers.
* ``Jun`` Proposed and lead the development of the [Romanian Semantic Textual Similarity](https://github.com/dumitrescustefan/RO-STS) dataset. It's a 1:1 high-quality human translation of the English STS dataset. 
* ``Apr``: Trained an released the *first monolingual Romanian BERT model*, which became the most used BERT model in Romania, with thousdands of monthly downloads.

#### 2019 and before

* [RoWordNet](https://github.com/dumitrescustefan/RoWordNet) [pip package](https://pypi.org/project/rowordnet/) providing quick access to the Romanian WordNet. After all these years it's still the only python plug-and-play package for Romanian - seems to be working well :)
* Developed [NLP-Cube](https://github.com/adobe/NLP-Cube) with [Tiberiu Boros](https://github.com/tiberiu44) (lead). Started as an entry in the 2018 Conll competition and evolved into a multilingual toolkit providing Tokenization, Sentence Segmentation, Lemmatization, POS and DEP parsing, trained on the Universal Dependencies dataset.
